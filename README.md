# sh-collection

A simple collection app for my RPG book collection built with php and MySQL. Users can view and add through the web page and changes are saved to the database.

## Installation

After cloning, import the database dump (`rpg-books.sql`) into your MySQL database named `rpg-books`.

## Run Locally

It can be run out of the box in docker using the ioAcademy docker image found at `https://github.com/iO-Academy/docker-image`.
